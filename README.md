# win10-mouse-natural-scroll

Intended to enable a natural scrolling feature for USB mouse under Windows 10 and Windows 11.

This script is no longer needed on Windows 11 24H2, which added a configuration option for
the scrolling direction.

## Get Started

```
.\mouse-natural-scroll.ps1
```

## To Disable

```
.\mouse-natural-scroll.ps1 reverse
```

For the change to have effect, the mouse should be disconnected and connected to the same port.
Alternatively, Windows should be restarted.
